# Monkeypox Analysis
 
## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the worldwide spread of monkeypox. The data includes cases from various countries over time, enabling an exploration of trends, growth rates, and possible correlations. The analysis could be useful for public health authorities, researchers, and anyone interested in understanding monkeypox trends globally.

The project contains datasets with time-series data of confirmed monkeypox cases by country and region. The main goals are:
- Visualizing the spread of monkeypox globally over time.
- Analyzing country-specific trends.
- Understanding the daily case progression in affected countries.

## Getting Started

To replicate the analysis in this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - If you'd like to download this repository, use the "Code" button in the GitHub repository and select "Download ZIP," or clone it using Git:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository-url>
     ```

2. **Requirements**:
   - Ensure you have [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) or [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html) installed to run the `.ipynb` notebook.
   - Install the following Python libraries (if not already installed):
     ```bash
     pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
     ```

3. **Open the Notebook**:
   - Run `monkeypox-analysis.ipynb` to see the full analysis. The notebook contains:
     - Data loading and initial exploration.
     - Time-series visualizations of monkeypox cases by country.
     - Analysis of daily confirmed cases.

## Project Highlights

1. **Timeline Visualization**: Examines the progression of monkeypox across countries, providing insights into how it spread over time.
2. **Daily Cases Analysis**: Helps to identify surges or declines in cases in each country, highlighting trends.
3. **Data-Driven Insights**: Utilizes multiple datasets for a comprehensive view of monkeypox's global impact.
